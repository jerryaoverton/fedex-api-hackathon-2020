# The Fedex Economy
**The Problem:** The FedEx APIs can turn the FedEx SameDay bots into a new way to fund small businesses. We can build a token economy where startups thrive. 

**The Hack:** The FedEx APIs allow the bots to make deliveries and accept FedEx tokens. The tokens fund startups. The startups are an engine for growth

**Potential Impact:** The bots become self-owning infrastructure that powers a small business ecosystem. The ecosystem generates block chain data that allow for new FedEx APIs.

## Overview
FedEx unveiled the SameDay Bot-- an autonomous vehicle for last-mile delivery. Using the FedEx APIs, we can transform the bots into a new way to fund small businesses. The FedEx APIs allow the bots to make deliveries and accept FedEx tokens. The tokens fund startups. The startups are an engine for growth. This is the idea behind FedEx economy. 

The FedEx APIs can do more than support apps. It can support a token economy where startups thrive.  And the resulting block chain data could make the FedEx APIs even more valuable.

## The Demo
The FedEx economy runs on FX tokens and is powered by a smart contract running on the block chain. Start by registering with the smart contract. You'll need FX tokens. You can buy them on the token exchange, you can earn them in the market, or they can be granted to you by FedEx (or anyone else with tokens.)

Let's start a business. Register in the marketplace. Create a profile and launch your startup. 

Let's buy something. Shop for products and services, place an order, and make a payment.

You can buy tokens on the exchange. You can sell your tokens on the exchange. Or, using your wallet, you can give your tokens away.

## The Design

We wrote a finite-state machine that extends the artificial intelligence of the FedEx Same-day bot. It turns the drone into self-owning infrastructure that earns FeX tokens by making deliveries and uses those tokens to pay for its maintenance. The drone AI depends on the FedEx APIs to validate delivery jobs sent by users of the marketplace. The drone also depends on the FedEx APIs to locate the a nearyby FedEx office. The drone is programmed to manage its own repairs. When it needs maintenance, the drone will hire a technician from the FedEx economy and arrange to meet the technician at a specified FedEx office.

The smart contract is a Python/Flask web service running on Heroku. In production, we'll deploy the smart contract as solidity code running on the live Etherium block chain. The FedEx marketplace is a Python/Flask website that communicates with the smart contract. We also wrote a finite-state machine that extends the artificial intelligence of the FedEx Same-day bot. The finite-state machine is a Python/Flask web service running on Heroku. It turns the drone into self-owning infrastructure that earns FX tokens by making deliveries and uses those tokens to pay for its maintenance.
