The Fedex Economy

The Vision

FedEx unveiled the SameDay Bot-- an autonomous vehicle for last-mile delivery. Using the FedEx APIs, we can transform the bots into a new way to fund small businesses. The FedEx APIs allow the bots to make deliveries and accept FedEx tokens. The tokens fund startups. The startups are an engine for growth. This is the idea behind FedEx economy.

Demo

The FedEx economy runs on FX tokens and is powered by a smart contract running on the block chain. Start by registering with the smart contract. You'll need FX tokens. You can buy them on the token exchange, you can earn them in the market, or they can be granted to you by FedEx (or anyone else with tokens.)

Let's start a business. Register in the marketplace. Create a profile and launch your startup. 

Let's buy something. Shop for products and services, place an order, and make a payment. Thanks to the FedEx APIs, you can hire a bot to make deliveries.

You can buy tokens on the exchange. You can sell your tokens on the exchange. Or, using your wallet, you can give your tokens away.

Architecture

The smart contract is a Python/Flask web service running on Heroku. In production, we'll deploy the smart contract as solidity code running on the live Etherium block chain. The FedEx marketplace is a Python/Flask website that communicates with the smart contract. We also wrote a finite-state machine that extends the artificial intelligence of the FedEx Same-day bot. The finite-state machine is a Python/Flask web service running on Heroku. It turns the drone into self-owning infrastructure that earns FX tokens by making deliveries and uses those tokens to pay for its maintenance.

Results

The FedEx APIs can do more than support apps. They can support a token economy where startups thrive.  And the resulting block chain data could make the FedEx APIs even more valuable. Welcome to the FedEx economy.

The Team

The virtual hackathon was hard work, but we enjoyed it.  Hitesh created the designs, Daniela and Shivani built the marketplace. Preethi built the drone software. And I'm Jerry, I wrote the smart contract. Thanks to FedEx for hosting us at the API Virtual Hackathon.
